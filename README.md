Odin Recipe Website Project
This is my first project exhibiting the basic HTML skills I have learned thus far. I will be creating an index file that links with recipes.
Additionally, I will be practicing my CLI tools as well as my GIT etiquette. 
This will be a basic HTML website consisting of proper structure, elements, links, and formatting.
