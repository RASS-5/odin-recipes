    <p>Bucatini is my fiancee's favorite pasta dish. It is a two part recipe consisting of using hollow spaghetti
        noodles called Bucatini, as well as creating a spicy red sauce using tomatoes, red pepper flakes, and pork 
        jowl called, "Guanciale." It is the first dish of my Italian themed recipe page.</p>
