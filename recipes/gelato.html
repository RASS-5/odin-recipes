    <h1>Homemade Gelato</h1>

    <p>Gelato will forever hold a sweet spot in my heart. I love everything about this frozen treat from the rich decadent flavors, all the way to the smooth
        low milk-fat mouth feel. Gelato is very similar to American Ice Cream - with the exception being that it uses much lower fat-containing milk. It's the
        perfect treat for a hot summer evening!
